# Fast DTA POC

This is a proof of concept project for the master's thesis on _Fast Dynamic Traffic Assignment using Engineered Shortest-Path Speedup Techniques_ by Henrik Cs√∂re.

## Using Podman

Assuming you have installed Podman on your machine, run the following command in the root directory of this project to build an image:

```bash
podman build -t fast-dta:latest .
```

Then, run a benchmark with

### Windows:

using Powershell:

```bash
podman run --rm -a=stdout -a=stderr -v ${PWD}\out:/app/out fast-dta:latest
```

### Linux/Mac:

```bash
podman run --rm -a=stdout -a=stderr -v ${PWD}/out:/app/out fast-dta:latest
```

This command will print the console outputs of the benchmark, move the output into the current working directory's `/out` directory and remove the container once it's finished.
